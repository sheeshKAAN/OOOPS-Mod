# OOOPS-mod
ooops mod was created by ooops in 2021 and is available in venge client. However, even though 2 years had passed, the mode was not working due to new updates and innovations. We have updated the v1.0.61 – v1.1.1 version of the ooops mode in 2021 in accordance with the new version of the game, and we will continue to update it in other versions.

# 890525.json Note:
The AWP gun that comes with the v1.2.21 update is not included in the 890525.json file prepared by Just joe. Therefore, AWP does not work in the game, does not harm assets outside of the AWP, and does not make any difference in the game. If you prefer not to use awp you can use the file.
