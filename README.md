# OOOPS Mod
OOOPS Mod was created by OOOPS and Nexi2k in 2020. However, after 2 years, the mode was not working due to updates and innovations. We have updated the OOOPS Mode in accordance with the new version of the game and made it available on the Venge Client, and we will continue to update it in other versions. *By downloading OOOPS Mod you promise to abide by the following rules:*

1- You should use the client without the intention of stealing the code or modifying the code in the client without permission from the developers.

2- Please refrain from spreading the client's GitHub link, and instead distribute the Discord link. 

3- The game's asset files belong to OOOPS Mod and Special Offers. Sharing of assets in any way without approval is prohibited.

‚ö†Ô∏è- **DO NOT open JSON files for any reason**, leave them as they are. Opening and modifying them is unauthorized _(not allowed)_ and the developers will know that you have opened and modified them, so do not attempt this or you may receive a _**PERMANET BAN**_.
